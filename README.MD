# SabreTools.Models

This library comprises of models that represent either directly serializable or representative structures for all SabreTools projects. All of the main models representing metadata files should have parsers created outside of the current code.

Find the link to the Nuget package [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SabreTools.Models).

## Missing Metadata Models

The following metadata file formats do not have models included in this library yet and, as such, do not have serializers:

- Missfile
- SabreJSON
- SabreDAT XML
